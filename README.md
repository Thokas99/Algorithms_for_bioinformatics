# Python Implementation of the Smith-Waterman Algorithm for Bioinformatics

### Course: Algorithms for Bioinformatics
### Professor: Enrico Blanzieri
### Academic Year: 2022-2023

### Abstract:
This project focuses on the implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm in Python, a widely used algorithm in bioinformatics for local sequence alignment. The goal is to develop a functional and efficient solution to identify similarities between biological sequences, such as DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. The project will be conducted as part of the Algorithms for Bioinformatics course, led by Professor Enrico Blanzieri.
